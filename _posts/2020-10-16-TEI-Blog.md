Text Coding Initiative in Digital Humanities
Kayla Brundick


With no previous experience, coding text looks like a bunch of random letters, numbers, and can be incredibly stressful. 
Throughout my semester in Digital Humanities, I have constantly been introduced to new topics that have allowed me to learn how to work with new computer programs that will help to strengthen my career and understanding of technology as an English major.

Digital Humanities involves many programs that involve coding. 
A specific type of coding used in Digital Humanities is known as TEI, which stands for ‘Text Coding Initiative.’ 
TEI has played a vital role in the DH field since the latter half of the 20th century since the use of technology has become more relevant. 
Although DH is a relatively new field of study, it has changed the way we expand scholarly work using technology and computers. 
By learning to work with TEI, we are able to analyze scholarly work and text for public display. 

For the purpose of this project, I was introduced to TEI by using a digital program called Oxygen XML Editor. 
This platform uses major operating systems that allow XML beginners and experts to use technology in order to create, edit, and publish XML documents. 

For my project, I have analyzed the first column on page 652 of an autobiography called “The Yellow Wall-Paper,” written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. 
This autobiography is about a young woman who severely struggles with mental health on a daily basis, in addition to having a husband who does not support her condition. 
Using my assigned column on page 652, I used Google Docs in order to begin a process called ‘Marking up Text.’ 
This then allowed me to begin coding the text by using tags in Oxygen XML Editor. 
By using this program, I was also able to see if my text was coded correctly by squares colored red and green. 
Red for incorrect code and green for correct code. 
This was helpful in the overall process as it allowed me to go back to different sections of my code and correct mistakes.

During class, we used Google Docs to mark up the text by labeling where paragraphs began and end as well as m-dashes in the text.
By doing this, it made coding in Oxygen Editor an easier process, since we had already labeled and marked up the text we would be working with. 
This also helped me to better understand the process of coding since I had learned to work with the text first. 
For new processes, it’s much better to take it one step at a time.

When beginning this project, I was skeptical about the coding. 
As an English major, I have had absolutely no background in coding, so this was a big concern at first. 
However, after working with Oxygen XML Editor for a week, I have begun to feel more comfortable with the coding process. 
I learned how to use specific tags to code a digital text into a computer platform that has allowed me exposure to the field of Digital Humanities. 
Wrapping the text in the correct code while paying attention to minor details was difficult at first; however, after going to my professor’s office hours, I was able to understand how minor details in code and wrapping the text properly is important to developing the right type of code.

Throughout the process of analyzing this project, I have successfully learned how to use Oxygen XML Editor, tags, and code my edits into a digital platform for public review. 
Although it was difficult at first having had limited exposure to coding, I learned how to work with TEI in the field of digital humanities in order to correctly code text. 
Additionally, after working with the program, I now understand the basics of TEI and its purpose in the Digital Humanities field. 
By having a well-rounded exposure to multiple online platforms, this will give me an advantage when advancing my career in the future.
