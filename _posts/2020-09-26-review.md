# The Marshall Project: A State-by-State Look at Coronavirus in Prisons

“A State-by-State Look at Coronavirus in Prions,” is an online journal and data base that provides updated figures counting the number of people infected and killed across the nation with those prisons that regularly publish their testing data. This is relevant as we deal with this seemingly everlasting coronavirus pandemic which is all we see on the news and social media today. The Marshall Project Site helps to educate the general public by allowing them to interact with graphs and charts in order to see how the virus is affecting them in their own state or surrounding communities. 

The interactive aspect of the project is beneficial because it allows those who work in the prisons to see the impact Covid-19 is having on their general workplace environment. For example, employees who work in prisons such as correctional officers or nurses are able to safe guard themselves by having access to the rise and fall of these statistics. 

It is important that the research for this project is continually updated in order for this to be helpful to anyone. Not only will this help to educate the residents living in the states, but it will also help protect the jobs within the prisons that keep them running on a daily basis. This also allows outside residents, prison employees, and prison employers to keep track of positive, negative and recovery cases of coronavirus that will allow them to take steps in further prevention and safety from the virus. 

However, most working adults do not work in or around prisons, so I wonder how big of an audience does The Marshall Project have? Realistically, even though I am involved in this pandemic and like to keep up to date, I have to wonder if I would have seen this if I wasn’t a student studying Digital Humanities. I believe if the authors and researchers behind this project were to include more information of how this affects the communities surrounding the prisons, if they might reach a bigger audience that could also benefit from this source of information.  

The interactive project does provide a section of research that is dedicated to “Staff members in your state,” and “what’s happening in your state,” however there are millions of more people that want to see how they are being affected during the pandemic, but wouldn’t be able to through this source as it only provides information about prisons. The employees that work in the prisons leave at the end of the day which means they are tracking potentially contagious germs in and out with them. This can then hurt the surrounding communities as this is a very rapid and easy way to spread a contagious disease. Additionally, not understanding exactly how the disease works and how it can affect the average individual only makes this situation more dangerous. 

Although the article is very thorough and informative, there could be a problem with the information being given as it is not holistically representative of the country. While most states and federal prisons are submitting their data for further study, some prisons are not submitting any data which can cause a complication with averages across the nation. Additionally, this causes and increased risk in the surrounding communities around the prisons that aren’t releasing information for research. 

Our understanding of the virus will only improve as tests become more readily available and research is continuously done in hopes to find a vaccine in the near future. In order for this to become the new reality, prisons need to submit any new research or documented percentages they receive on a daily if not weekly basis. Not only will this protect the prisoners, but the surrounding communities and states as well.

I recommend this project to anyone as it is important to keep up with the daily news, especially regarding this pandemic as it has only caused more panic and chaos throughout the world.
