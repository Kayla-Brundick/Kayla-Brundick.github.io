Final Grant Review

By: Kayla Brundick

Throughout the grant writing process, I have grown more and more comfortable in my ability to complete the necessary components to a Grant. 
So far throughout the process, I have developed a Grant Proposal, Environmental Scan, Bibliography, CV, Resume, Appendix, and Grant Narrative. 
Since I have never created a grant before, this process seemed daunting at first; however, after multiple class discussions and peer reviews on all the documents listed above, I feel confident in my ability to present the project by the final due date. 
Additionally, since my last grant process review, I have created a CV, Resume, Appendix, and Grant Narrative which had further expanding my understanding of my project. 

Since my last grant review, I have learned that I love the idea of my project and what it can provide to the fans of the Twilight non-fiction series. 
Because of this, I would like to submit my grant to CNU in order to physically create the project. 
Not only will this give me experience in the field of Digital Humanities, but this will also give me an excellent project to include in my resume as I start my career moving forward. 
I believe this will give me an advantage as I apply to internships and jobs in the future, as most college students have never had experience with the grant writing process, let alone, submitting a real grant proposal to publish a project. 
I am very excited to begin this project next semester and I look forward to completing the process as a final development of what I have imagined my project to look like so far in the process. 

Even though I am excited to submit my grant proposal to CNU and start the process, I am concerned in my ability to use StoryMaps to develop project. 
I have never used any kind of digital mapping software before, but I look forward to learning how to use the software in order to develop my final project and creating a new edition for twilight fans to interact with. 

Throughout this process, writing this grant has changed my understanding of the project as I develop new thoughts and ideas to add to my project in order to create an interactive model of the thoughts I want to include from the perspectives of each character. 

The final part of my grant process is creating an appendix. 
At first, I was not comfortable in my ability to create an appendix since I have never created one before. 
After going to office hours, and receiving clarification on what an appendix was, I have decided to draw a visual representation of what I image my grant to look like within the StoryMaps Software. 
Below is a picture of the visual representation of what I want to develop within my mapping software. 



In the picture above, I have included a map of the time of Forks, Washington. 
I have also included a closer picture of the map that focused on Forks High School since that is where the story of Bella and Edward began. 
The red circles on the map represents the different locations that readers would be able to click on in order to see the characterâ€™s development sequentially on map. 

In conclusion, I look forward to completing the process as my final for my digital humanities course, in addition to submitting my grant proposal to CNU in order to begin the development of my project. 
I also am looking forward to what this will allow me to do in the future having working through the grant writing process.
